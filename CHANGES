v0.5.0
------


v0.4.0
------
- Added warning when writing to an existing file in a ZIP archive.
  Writing to an existing file does not replace the contents of that file, but
  instead creates a duplicate entry. Calling `ZipPath.write_text()` or `write_bytes()`
  to an existing file will now raise a `ZipPathDuplicateFileWarning`.

- Added methods to `ZipPath` API to detect and purge duplicate entries:
  - `scan_for_duplicates()` returns a list of `(str, int) tuples, of all
    duplicated entries and their instance counts

  - `purge_duplicates()` removes duplicates by creating a copy of the current
    ZIP archive, copying only the latest version of each file, and then replacing
    the current ZIP archive with the purged copy

- Added CLI `--check` option, support for checking for large files or duplicates.

- Added CLI `--purge` option, support for purging duplicates, retaining only the latest.


v0.3.0
------
- Added features to support a guard limit to prevent accidental extraction of
  ZIP bombs:
  - in the CLI, a --limit option defaults to 2G, but permits manual override to
    larger or smaller values
  - in the API, `ZipPath`'s now have a `size()` method to show the size of a file
    entry, and a `total_size()` method to show the aggregate size of all files
    contained within a directory and any subdirectories
  - earlier versions extracted a file to then find the `len()` of the fetched data;
    changed to determine a file entry's uncompressed size based on the
    `ZipInfo.size()` method.

- Added -V CLI option and `__version__` package attribute to get the current
  package version.


v0.2.0
------
- Merged the `--outputdir` command line option into the `--extract` option

- Fixed extract code to always preserve internal ZIP directory hierarchy; fixed
  duplicate file write bug; raise error if trying to extract a directory to stdout

- Deleted `name`, `stem`, and `suffix` properties, inherit from `PurePath` class.

- Cleanup README and pyproject.toml omissions


v0.1.0
------
- Initial release.
